Regression Challenge Project 

Part of Codecademy's Data Scientist Career path, the goal of the project is, according to Codecademy, to "create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits". The data is from the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data, although I am unsure as to how Codecademy acquired the data. I completed this project on Codecademy's platfor using python 3. The packages employed were Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
